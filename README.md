### Hello! I'm Upasana.

👩🏽‍💻 🌱 🥞 I’m a software engineer and open source contributor. I'm constantly cultivating my skills; as of late, I've been developing fullstack applications using TypeScript, React, REST APIs, Node, Express, NoSQL databases, and Docker, as well as exploring message broker and caching implementations in scaled systems.  
I’m a co-creator of the nascent Docker Desktop Extension Kafka Sonar. For developers monitoring or troubleshooting containerized Kafka microservices, Sonar supplements Docker’s comprehensive event logging with visualized cluster health and throughput analytics.  
Deep dive into Sonar on [Medium](https://medium.com/@upnata/making-waves-with-kafka-sonar-leveraging-docker-to-streamline-kafka-cluster-monitoring-and-19613a4463b2).  
Preview and install from [Docker's Extensions Marketplace](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=kafkasonar/kafkasonar).  
I also co-presented [“A Caching Toolkit”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-angtcI40eX-gkLWX7yxwZvnDX5vn2s/view?usp=sharing), which covers critical questions engineers should answer before incorporating caches into a distributed system.

✏️ 👩🏽‍💼 I'm a Neuroscience and Mathematics undergraduate with 10y+ experience spanning IT solutions consulting to mobile support engineering. With 6y+ in responsive web design and A/B testing, I shine in design- and data-driven development. I've led Agile development, design, and consulting initiatives from kick off to launch on both onsite and global teams of 6-30, in close collaboration with other principal cross-functional product stakeholders (i.e. POs, PMs, dev leads, C-suite, top-tier external clients inc IBM, Deepwater Horizon Economic Claims Center, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines).

☕ I'm happy to grab a coffee (either virtually or IRL) and [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/upasananatarajan/) about new engineering roles. Though I'm currently based out of Atlanta, I'm open to remote roles and relocating for the right opportunity.
