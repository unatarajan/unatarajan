### Hello! I'm Upasana.

👩🏽‍💻 🌱 🥞 I’m a software engineer and open source contributor. I'm constantly cultivating my skills; as of late, I've been developing fullstack applications using TypeScript, React, REST APIs, Node, Express, NoSQL databases, and Docker, as well as exploring message broker and caching implementations in scaled systems.
I’m a co-creator of the nascent Docker Desktop Extension Kafka Sonar. For developers monitoring or troubleshooting containerized Kafka microservices, Sonar supplements Docker’s comprehensive event logging with visualized cluster health and throughput analytics.
Dive deep into Sonar on: [Medium](https://medium.com/@upnata/making-waves-with-kafka-sonar-leveraging-docker-to-streamline-kafka-cluster-monitoring-and-19613a4463b2).
Install and get started: [Docker's Extensions Marketplace](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=kafkasonar/kafkasonar).
I also co-presented [“A Caching Toolkit”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-angtcI40eX-gkLWX7yxwZvnDX5vn2s/view?usp=sharing), which covers critical questions engineers should answer before incorporating caches into a distributed system.

✏️ 👩🏽‍💼 I'm a Neuroscience and Mathematics undergraduate with 10+ years' experience in technology. With 6+ years in responsive web design and A/B testing, I shine in design- and data-driven development. I've led Agile development, design, and consulting initiatives, as well as mentoring, on teams of 6-30, and interviewed and presented to principal cross-functional product stakeholders (i.e. POs, PMs, dev leads, C-suite, and top-tier external clients including IBM).

☕ I'm happy to grab a coffee (either virtually or IRL) and [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/upasananatarajan/) about new engineering roles. Though I'm currently based out of Atlanta, I'm open to remote roles and relocating for the right opportunity.
